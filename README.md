ChatGPT Plugin that allows users to grab recent news based on a topic and date

“QuickNews”. A plugin that connects to a news API (e.g., NewsAPI) to provide the latest news articles and headlines based on user-defined topics and date ranges. Users can ask for news on a particular topic eg “crypto” or “politics” on a specific date or over a range of dates, eg “over the past week”.

Usage:
1. Upload code to Replit and make sure you change the Repl URL to match up with yours
2. Go to ChatGPT-4 and go to the Plugin Store and click "Develop your own plugin"
3. Copy your Repl URL and hit "Find Manifest file" (e.g. news-plugin--victorchan88.repl.co)
4. Now you can see the QuickNews Plugin and you can check it off to use it
5. Enter in a line such as "Give me a bullet point summary for last week's crypto news"
6. ChatGPT should now use the QuickNews Plugin to fetch news
